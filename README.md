# Library for astronomical calculations.

I'm implementing many of the algorithms from ["Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd Ed." by Jean Meeus](https://www.amazon.com/Astronomical-Algorithms-Jean-Meeus/dp/0943396611/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486964675&sr=8-1&keywords=astronomical+algorithms). This is my working repository. I'm also learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).

## Status
Currently I'm in the process of implementing the sections related to time. This repository will grow with more modules as I implement more sections.
