# Library for astronomical calculations.

I'm implementing many of the algorithms from "Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd Ed." by Jean Meeus. This is my working repository. I'm also learning RUST.

## Status
Currently I'm in the process of implementing the sections related to time. This repository will grow with more modules as I implement more sections.
